	<p>
		hi im naraa im 24 and i like to program stuff sometimes
	<br>
		i mainly have experience in python html/css and some javascript/lua aswell  
	<br>
		i started making this website around 3 years ago and thats where i started learning how to program in general even tho html isnt technically a programming language
	<br>
		my second project was my discord bot which i kind of gave up on after discord wildly changed their api priviliges
